This is a modified version of Peter Fleury I2Cmaster library for any AVR devices. 
See his homepage for more information: 
http://homepage.hispeed.ch/peterfleury/group__pfleury__ic2master.html

Ths library is modified to work with the Lego Ultrasonic Sensor (I2C frequency set to 11494,253Hz),
and the CPU frequency has been set to the Arduino (16MHz).

It is entended to work with the NXT Shield (http://blog.tkjelectronics.dk/2011/10/nxt-shield-ver2/)
by Kristian Lauszus

The reason why one can not use the official I2C library (Wire.h) is that it does not support repeated start.

Keywords has also been added.
